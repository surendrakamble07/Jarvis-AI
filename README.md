🧩 1. Prepare Your Project Folder

Make sure your Jarvis AI project folder looks something like this:

Jarvis-AI/
├── Backend/
├── Frontend/
├── main.py
├── requirements.txt
└── README.md


If you don’t have a README.md yet, create one:

echo "# Jarvis AI" > README.md


Or open VS Code and create a file named README.md with your project details.

🚀 2. Initialize Git (if not done yet)

Open terminal or PowerShell in your project folder and run:

git init


This creates a hidden .git folder to track changes.

🧾 3. Add Your Files
git add .


This stages all files (including README.md) for commit.

🧩 4. Commit Your Changes
git commit -m "Initial commit with Jarvis AI project and README"

☁️ 5. Create a New Repository on GitHub

Go to GitHub → New Repository

Enter your repository name (e.g., Jarvis-AI)

Keep it Public (optional: add description)

Do not add README on GitHub since you already have one

Click Create Repository

🔗 6. Connect Local Folder to GitHub Repo

Copy the commands shown by GitHub after creating the repo.
They usually look like this:

git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-username>/Jarvis-AI.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main


Example:

git remote add origin https://github.com/surendrakamble07/Jarvis-AI.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
