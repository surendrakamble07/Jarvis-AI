Jarvis: Hello Surendra! It's nice to meet you. What can I assist you with today?
Surendra Kamble: Google assistant if you want to automatically your pc to use using your voice command.
Jarvis: You're referring to voice-controlled desktop access. For that, you can use Google Assistant with Chrome OS or Windows 10 devices that have the Google Assistant app installed. Additionally, you can also use Google's "Voice Access" feature, which allows you to control your desktop with voice commands.
Surendra Kamble: (query).
Jarvis: You're looking for the voice command to activate Google Assistant. The voice command is: "Ok Google" or "Hey Google".
