It seems like you want me to write a letter or an application to request the copying of files. Here's a sample:

**Request to Copy Files**

Dear [Recipient's Name],

I am writing to request your assistance in copying some important files from one location to another. The files in question are [list the files or provide a brief description, e.g., "all documents related to Project XYZ"].

I would like to have these files copied from [original location, e.g., "the server"] to [new location, e.g., "an external hard drive"]. This is necessary for [provide a brief reason, e.g., "backup purposes" or "for further analysis"].

Could you please arrange for the files to be copied at your earliest convenience? If there are any concerns or issues, please do not hesitate to reach out to me.

Thank you for your help in this matter.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]

If you need any modifications or have a specific scenario in mind, feel free to let me know!
