Here is a sample command to copy all files from the "Jarvis AI" folder and the "Phase 2 Attachment" folder:

**Windows Command Prompt:**

```
xcopy /s "C:\Path\To\Jarvis AI\*" "C:\Destination\Folder"
xcopy /s "C:\Path\To\Phase 2 Attachment\*" "C:\Destination\Folder"
```

**Mac/Linux Terminal:**

```
cp -r /Path/To/Jarvis\ AI/* /Destination/Folder
cp -r /Path/To/Phase\ 2\ Attachment/* /Destination/Folder
```

**Note:** 

* Replace `C:\Path\To\Jarvis AI` and `C:\Path\To\Phase 2 Attachment` with the actual paths to the folders you want to copy from.
* Replace `C:\Destination\Folder` with the actual path to the folder you want to copy to.
* The `/s` option in the Windows command stands for "subdirectories" and will copy all files and subfolders from the source folder.
* The `-r` option in the Mac/Linux command stands for "recursive" and will copy all files and subfolders from the source folder.
