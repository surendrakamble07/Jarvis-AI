Here's a message for leave of absence for a vacation:

"Dear [Manager's Name],

I am writing to request a leave of absence from [start date] to [end date] as I have planned a vacation during this period. I will be taking [number] days off to recharge and spend some quality time with my loved ones.

I have reviewed my tasks and ensured that all my work is up to date. I have also made arrangements to complete all my pending tasks before my leave, and I am confident that my absence will not affect the team's productivity.

I would greatly appreciate it if you could approve my leave request. If there are any concerns or issues, please let me know and I will do my best to address them.

Thank you for your understanding and support.

Sincerely,
Surendra Kamble"
